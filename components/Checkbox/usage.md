### Usage
- Used when there are multiple choices, and more than one option can be selected.
- Consider using a multi-select if there are several(+) choices — something to consider if your form is long, or space is limited.
- Checkboxes are preferable over a multi-select when it’s important that the user sees the options available to them, to understand and consider, versus a more passive scan of their options via a multi-select.
